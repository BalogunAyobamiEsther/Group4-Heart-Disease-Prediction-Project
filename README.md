# Heart Disease Risk Prediction  
**Data Dominators Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global health challenge, and early detection through data-driven models can support timely diagnosis and improved healthcare decision-making.

The goal of this project is to analyze key health indicators, develop predictive models, and evaluate their effectiveness in identifying patients at risk of heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of patient health records containing medically relevant attributes, including:
- Age and sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol levels  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting electrocardiographic results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  

These features serve as inputs for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## 🔍 Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and validation  
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Feature inspection and preparation  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries  
- Feature distribution analysis  
- Correlation analysis and visual insights  

### 3. Model Development
The following supervised learning algorithms were implemented:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  

### 4. Model Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix

## 🧪 Results and Insights
Comparative analysis shows that ensemble-based models, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, achieved stronger predictive performance. The results highlight the significance of key clinical indicators in heart disease prediction and emphasize the importance of model evaluation in healthcare applications. While, SVM had the highest recall (94%), meaning it was best at identifying true positive heart disease cases and Logistic Regression achieved the most balanced and interpretable performance overall.
