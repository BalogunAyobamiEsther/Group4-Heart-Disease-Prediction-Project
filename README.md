# Heart Disease Risk Prediction  
**Data Dominators Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global health challenge, and early detection through data-driven models can support timely diagnosis and improved healthcare decision-making.

The goal of this project is to analyze key health indicators, develop predictive models, and evaluate their effectiveness in identifying patients at risk of heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of patient health records containing medically relevant attributes, including:
- Age and sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol levels  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting electrocardiographic results  
- Maximum heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  

These features serve as inputs for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
